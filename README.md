# Paper 2: Cyberbullying Detection using Explainable and Responsible AI to Engage Parents and Teachers 

### Full Model Train

- Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- Scripts/run_all_models.py
  - Adjust variables in common.py as needed

### TODO
 
 - Complete Incorporation MLFlow-like custom run system
   - Hyperparameter Optimization (defer to possible move to Huggingface)
   - Full capture of all required data, metadata, and intermediate data

 - Include post analysis Matplotlib plots and graphs
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Multiple Performance metrics per experiment
   - Comparison of Best Performance metrics for multiple experiments
   - Comparison of Baseline metrics with new Architecture
     - Binary Signal Architecture vs. Previous multi-model architecture

 - Synthetic Data Generation and Creation of Unique Data Set Using
   - Second IEEE Dataset
   - Twitter Dataset from prior paper (Bangladesh)
